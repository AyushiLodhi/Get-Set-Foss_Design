**PROJECT 1 :   APP PROTOTYPE**
 --- **THEME : Food Delivery App**


**PROJECT 2 :  WEB PROTOTYPE**
 --- **THEME : Library portal**




**TASKS TO BE COMPLETED :**
1. Ideate and sketch your initial steps for the prototype, and submit the design of rough low fi wireframes.
  This task will credit you **20 %** of the total points.
2. Sumbit a file of low fi wireframes of all the screens. Prototyping is not required in this step.
  This task will credit you **30 %** of the total points.
3. A final file ( or a link of the file ) with high fidelity prototype has to be submitted after the completion of above mentioned tasks. This task will credit you **50 %** of the total points. 

Additional **30%** of the total points will be credited at the end (*only to those who complete all 3 tasks*). These points will be based on the design, idea and how close you were in solving the user's issues.





**GUIDELINES FOR APP PROTOTYPE :**

1. Use your own brand.
2. Include default screens (login , signup, transactions , cart).
3. Include home screen with advertising partner, restautrants, offers/coupon, search bar/navigation bar, customer care, wallet.
4. First you need to analyse all the issues that a consumer faces while ordering food. You have to solve those problems.
5. Remember that your target user is Young Professionals staying away from home who order food daily (like us) . 
6. Analyse the situation : There are 2 types of people, one who order food once a day(Dinner) and the other, those who order food twice (Lunch and Dinner).
7. Make a list of all these issues and make sure that you come up with something that solves these issues. ( task 1 will credit you 20% points for the same ).





**GUIDELINES FOR WEB PROTOTYPE :** 

1. A login page that asks for LDAP details is must.
2. UI related to library log of each student which is managed by the administration. 
3. Screens that cover Ebooks must be present. Options so that students can upload files, books, study material and articles.

**DETAILED DESCRITPTION OF TASKS AND SCORING CRITERIA :**
1. Design low fidelity designs on paper. All the rough stuff that you do on paper must be uploaded so that we can see how you worked throughout and you will earn points for this. (20%)
2. Decide the number of screens that you want to keep. More number of useless screens is not what we want. We want you to add important and useful screens.
3. Design low fi wireframes of all the screens. Upload all the screens as a file containing images in jpg or png format.(30%)
4. Add images to your low fi wireframes. 
5. Design high fidelity prototype using any software tool you feel comfortable with.
6. Connect all the screens to make it a hand on experience.
7. Upload the high fidelity prototype. ( A link can be added of whatever software you use.) (50%)
8. Complete points will be given to the one who completes all the tasks.
9. Then additional 30% points will depend on the designs and how close you were in solving user problems.
